      <h3>Examples</h3>
      <p>
        This section demonstrates the various, charts, features and
        parsers that come bundled with d4. The charts you
        find here can be considered the canon of charts common to
        financial and business applications. If you have an idea
        for a more exotic breed, please do submit a pull-request!

      <h4>Charts</h4>
      <p>The following section demonstrates mostly boilerplate
        examples of the common chart. It is relatively trivial to
        make a chart type. Most of the hard work is in writing the
        features themselves.
